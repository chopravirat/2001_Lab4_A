Prop: It is not worthwhile for developing countries to host large sporting events like the Olympics
Case Setup
Preamble:
From Brazilâ€™s economic, social and governmental downturn in the last 6 years to the multitude of deaths in Qatar in their quest to host the FIFA world cup, we on proposition believe the idea that large public spectacles like the Olympics bring prosperity to the developing nation is false and something that we on government vehemently deny.
Baseline: 
Thus we would posit two things in this debate today:
1.	That the opportunity cost of spending billions of dollars on such events while the country remains in a dire state is too high to be undertaken by a developing state in a just manner and doing so represents a moral and social wrong against the citizens of the state. 
2.	That the impact of infrastructure development required for these events is hugely detrimental to the development of the nation state and debunk the myth of these tournaments bringing economic development and investments into the country.
Definitions:
Developing Nations: These are countries with staggered economic development, low median wages, highly combustible social fabric and very low amounts of welfare and state responsibilities. To draw examples, this would mean countries like India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Malaysia etc. 
Policy: 
We believe that only countries with their Human Development Index above 8.5 should be allowed to host the Olympics. Which is to say, if the policy had pre-emptively been in place, countries like Greece (Athens, 2004) and Brazil (Rio, 2016) would not have been able to bid for the rights to host the Olympics. 
That also means, only around 
30 countries across the world such as the United States, Korea and the Nordic region will be in contention to hold the Olympics. We will elaborate later as to why that is the best case scenario we can come to. 
Case Divide:
1.	Ethical and Social responsibility of the nation state towards it citizens
2.	Prudent economic policies and a comparative between spending on the events vs spending on long term development in terms of overall impacts.
